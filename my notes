Key Variables
imageCount = how many images total
imageWidth = width of each image
totalWidth = full width of the strip (all images side by side)
leftPosition = how far to shift the strip to show the correct image
counter = which image you’re on (0 = first image)

🔎 Version 1 — Basic Slideshow (Infinite Loop, Simple)
This is a pretty standard manual slideshow — you’re just sliding the ul left or
right using animate(). When you hit the end, the counter loops back to 0.

Key Things
✅ On next click, counter++ moves you forward.
✅ On previous click, counter-- moves you back.
✅ If counter gets too high (at the end), it resets to 0 (first image).
✅ If counter goes negative (at the beginning), it wraps to the last image.

Animation

- $('#slider ul').animate({left: leftPosition}, 700, 'easeInQuad');
- Moves the whole image strip to the correct spot.
- easeInQuad is a fancy easing animation (slows in smoothly).
  Simple, but no cloning. Just shifts and loops.

🔎 Version 2 — Fancy Cloning Version (Seamless Looping)
This one is more advanced — it creates a clone of the ul at the end or start so the animation feels smoother and can wrap seamlessly.

Key Differences
✅ When you hit the last image (counter === imageCount), it:

- Clones the ul
- Appends the clone to #slider
- Puts the new ul just off-screen to the right.
- Slides the new ul into place.
- Slides the old ul off the screen.
- Deletes the old ul.
  ✅ The same logic applies when moving backwards from the first slide — it clones the ul and puts it off-screen to the left.

Why Clone?
This avoids a “jump” effect when the slideshow resets. Instead of snapping back to the first slide, it looks like it keeps sliding smoothly. Much more pro-looking.

💡 Key jQuery Methods Used
Method & What It Does
.on('load') Runs the whole thing after the page loads.
.click() Adds the click handler.
.animate() Moves the slideshow left/right.
.clone() Duplicates the ul to create smooth looping.
.appendTo() Adds the cloned ul at the end of #slider.
.remove() Deletes the old ul after the animation.
.css() Sets the initial width and positioning for the ul.

✍️ Big Takeaways:

- counter tracks which image is visible.
- leftPosition calculates how far to move the whole ul.
- Basic slideshows just animate the ul left/right.
- Fancier slideshows clone ul to make wrapping smoother.
- Easing (easeInQuad) gives a smoother animation feel.
- .animate() is a core jQuery method you’ll use a lot.
